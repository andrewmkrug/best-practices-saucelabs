In order to complete these exercises you must complete the following prerequisite installation and configuration steps:

Once your test environment is up and running, refer to the [exercise guides](exercise-guides/getting-started.md) to begin the exercises.

### Install Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/doc) is a version control system that lets you check out code from a repository, 
work with that code on your own branch, and then merge that code with any changes that have been made by other developers. 
Git is an essential tool for distributed development teams, and is a critical component of the continuous 
integration/continuous development toolchain.
